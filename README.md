## Installing and Running Backend API
1. Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Install packages with pip3: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run API: `venv/bin/uvicorn claude_scorer_api:app --reload`

That's all the basic set-up. To test API, you can go to http://localhost:8000/docs#/default/ and try it for yourself.
